In this project, you will build a set of football team cards and learn about nested objects, object destructuring, default parameters, event listeners, and switch statements. All of the HTML and CSS for this project has been provided for you.

Start by accessing the id called team from the HTML document and storing it in a const variable called teamName.

Remember, you can use the getElementById method for this.
